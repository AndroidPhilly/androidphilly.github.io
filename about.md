Android Philly is a community of Android Developers, Designers and Enthusiasts in and around Philadelphia. Our main meetings are organized on the last Wed of every month. You can keep track of upcoming events on our [Meetup Page](www.meetup.com/AndroidAlliancePhilly/) or by following us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/androidphilly). A lot of the developers also hang out at the #Android-dev channel on [The Philly Dev Slack](http://phillydev.org).

AndroidPhilly is organized by Arpit, Chuck, Corey and John.
