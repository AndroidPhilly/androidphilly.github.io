A few weeks ago the Android Philly organizational team had sent out a survey to get a better idea of how we were doing and how we will run it next year. I'd like to thank everyone who filled in that survey. Here are some results from that survey:

This has some very good take-aways for us here. Generally it does seem our events do attract more experts than beginners though I might say anecdotally that the beginners do come back more often. Also following the data here, we will try to do more beginner events to get more people started with Android.

The interest in iOS is good to see as well. We have an event that we are starting to plan out for next year that will bring the Philadelphia iOS and Android dev groups together (like [RedSnake](http://redsnakephilly.org/) did for Ruby and Python communities a couple of years ago). Stay tuned for that one.

I'll do another post soon on a number of interesting new ideas for next year that came through the survey as well. Meanwhile, if you want to reach out to any of us on the organization team, please ping on on the [PhillyDev #Android-dev Slack channel](http://phillydev.org).
